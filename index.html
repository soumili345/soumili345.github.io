    <p> Welcome! My name is Soumili and this is a snippet of my life.
        Currently, I am a student at Northeastern University where I am studying cell 
        and molecular biology and data science. My goal is to work in the biotechnology
        industry and develop therapies for marginalized populations. Outside of the lab,
        I indulge in activities such as hiking, baking, and making art!

    <p> Some elements I wish to include in my website in the future:
    <ul>
        <li>An art portfolio with some of my best pieces as a separate page</li>
        <li>A compilation of the best hiking photos I have taken</li>
        <li>A baking tutorial with my recipe and photos</li>

    </ul>
